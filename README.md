# MLib
###### Credits to navoyan's LirandAPI for the inspiration and some of the code.
This is a library for PaperMC Kotlin Minecraft Plugins. It is a collection of utilities and tools that I have found useful in my own plugins. It is not meant to be a standalone plugin, but rather a library that can be included in your own plugins.

It is still a work in progress, and I will be adding more features as I need them in my own plugins. If you have any suggestions or requests, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
